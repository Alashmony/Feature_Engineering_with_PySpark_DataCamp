    "## Where to Begin\n",
    "1. Where to Begin\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, I'm John Hogue and welcome to Feature Engineering with PySpark. Easily one of the most important aspects of applied machine learning is feature engineering. It is the process of using domain knowledge to create new features to help our models perform better. In this course, we will look at a real data set and work our way to building a Regression Model in PySpark.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Diving Straight to Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in its important to note that while the techniques you'll learn in this course are invaluable, that data science cannot be applied as a cookie cutter. You will need to research your data and become your own expert. There is much to be said of the dangers of not understanding your data, especially where our outputs are increasingly being used to make decisions and inform policies. Before you dive into modeling, spend time to define what your goals are and how the output might be used. Take the time to research your data and its limitations. Often times you may be tasked with explaining what is and isn't possible. Lastly, remember that data science is all about being curious, asking questions and applying new ways to solve problems!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Data Science Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Every project and data set is different. Data Science is an iterative process that requires comfort with uncertainty as at any point you may have to go backward or even start over. A good project may inspire further questions that set the goals for the next project! As we progress through this process, this course will have extra emphasis on a lot of the 'art' sides of data science, exploring data, cleaning it and engineering it for use in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Spark changes fast and frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, as a cutting-edge technology, Spark changes fast and frequently. Make sure you are looking at the right version! You can always go to the latest URL by using slash latest or put the version number, major, minor and patch to get a specific version. Programmatically you can check your version of Spark with these commands. That way you can ensure you are looking at the right documentation and not using deprecated methods!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Formats: Parquet\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we will be using a Parquet file. Like most data in Hadoop, the platform that Spark runs on, it is a write once, read many times format. Parquet data is columnar, meaning that it is organized by columns, an important feature for huge data sets as it is blazingly fast to read in ONLY the data you need. CSVs, on the other hand, have to read and parse the whole data set to read a single field. Another difference is Parquet fields are defined and typed, saving users from defining data types, like dates, booleans, or strings. For this reason, parquet is relatively slow to write. Since it's not delimited by characters it's less likely to be read in wrong if those characters exist in the data. These are just a few advantages that are causing the industry to adopt Parquet quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Getting the Data to Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "We have many format readers to choose from for converting various file types to a PySpark DataFrame. Here we will use spark read parquet and put the results into the variable df representing a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Let's Practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, we covered off on some important considerations when starting any data science project. We also learned about parquet and how to load it to a spark dataframe. In the exercises, you'll verify the versioning of PySpark and Python and finally, you'll load the data yourself!"

    "\n",
    "We are going to build a model to predict how much a house sells for. This question can be interpreted multiple ways which is why it's important to take the time formally define it. Let's assume we are real-estate tycoon's looking for the next best investment opportunity. For a given house on the market, with a listed price and series of attributes describing the home, what is it likely to actually sell for, aka the SALESCLOSEPRICE?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Context & Limitations of our Real Estate\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we have is a sample of homes that sold over the course of 2017. Using this sample we are to provide a quick proof of concept of whether it's worth investing in more data for the 5.5 million homes that sold in the US in 2017. To do this we need to understand some of the limitations of the data we have. First, we only have a small geographical area, so to apply our model to new areas, poses serious risk! We know that we only have residential data, so we shouldn't expect to predict how much a business location is worth! Lastly, we only have one year's worth of data which will make it hard to draw strong conclusions about seasonality in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What types of attributes are available?\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset has hundreds of attributes available but in order to start simple we've already worked with our client to identify around 50 attributes they think are likely to influence the price of a home. These attributes generally fall into these groups. For Dates we have date listed, and the year the home was built. For locational data, we have the city that the home is in, its school district and its actual postal address. We also have many different metrics to gauge the size of the home like number of bed and bathrooms as well as the area of living space. For prices, we have the listing price and we wouldn't be able to predict anything without the sale price! We also have a lot of data available on amenities that a house has like a pool or a garage as well as the construction materials used to build the house.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Getting Descriptive with DataFrame.describe()\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with understanding your data take a peek at each column to see what they contain. The describe function provides some bare bones basics of Count, Mean, Std Dev, Min and Max. You can run it on the whole dataframe, a single column or a list of columns. Remember to add show to the end if you wish to immediately display results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Many descriptive functions are already available\n",
    "\n",
    "To further help us understand our data, Pyspark has many built-in descriptive functions available.\n",

    "4. Example with mean()\n",

    "The Mean function is considered an aggregate function and as such needs to be passed to the agg method along with the column to run it on as a dictionary. Spark uses lazy evaluation, meaning that it waits to execute code until a specific type of command, called an action forces it to. To force it to return the results immediately, use the collect function.\n",

    "An excellent way to explore your data is through statistical plotting. Seaborn is a Python data visualization library designed specifically for this. We will look at a few plotting examples but there are many, many more for you to follow up on.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Notes on plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "We can plot data using non-Spark libraries like Seaborn but they require converting your pySpark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame. Be aware that converting large datasets can cause Pandas to crash. This is because PySpark is made for massive datasets, where pandas is not. The Sample function can help us get a smaller dataset to plot. Here, we will keep sampling with replacement off, take 50% of the data and set a random seed for reproducibility. Using count shows us that the number of records has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Prepping for plotting a distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leverage Seaborn's distplot which will show us the distribution of our dependent variable 'SalesClosePrice'. Please note there are many optional parameters which aren't covered here. Here we import seaborn, then filter the Spark DataFrame down to the SalesClosePrice column and sample it. Then we convert it into a pandas dataframe so we can use it with Seaborn. Lastly, call the distplot function with pandas underscore df to plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Distribution plot of sales closing price\n",
    "\n",
    "After plotting we can we can see that most of the data is pushed to the left, something that may need to be remedied depending on the model type we choose. We will cover one option, log scaling, in 'Adjusting Data' later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Relationship plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great plot to use is lmplot. lm is short for linear model and allows us to quickly see if there is a linear relationship between two variables. For this example, we will look at how 'SalesClosePrice' changes depending on 'SQFTABOVEGROUND'. To do this we will import seaborn, filter our dataset to the two columns, sample it and then convert it to a pandas DataFrame. Lastly, use the sns lmplot function with our x and y columns and dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Linear model plot between SQFT above ground and sales price\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can see there is what looks to be a strong relationship between the size of a home and the price it sells for. Therefore we might make the assumption that SQFTABOVEGROUND is a good variable to consider in predicting house prices!\n",

    "## Dropping data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dropping Data\n",
    "\n",
    "More data is better right? Not if its bad data! The saying \"garbage in, garbage out\" is doubly true in data science!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Where can data go bad?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data has a lot of places where it can get messed up. Data may be recorded incorrectly or contain extreme events. Inconsistent formatting such as mixing numeric and text data can make a field hard to use. Duplications can add redundant observations. Missing data can cause your analysis to have blind spots. Lastly, sometimes the data is just not relevant to the analysis. Failure to account for bad data can set your analysis up to fail. Please be careful!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dropping Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspecting our data we can see there are some columns that are not worth including in our analysis. NO is just the record number, UNITNUMBER is the apartment or house number, and CLASS is completely constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dropping Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropping the columns requires entering a single column name or passing a list of columns to drop. Here we pass a list called cols_to_drop to the function and then drop them. Please note the star, which tells the function to unpack the list and feed them to the function one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Text Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "A common task in cleaning your data will be filtering it. Here we will filter records that contain specific text values. Where applies the filter to the dataframe records. Like creates a True/False condition for the records. The Tilde provides a way to take the opposite, or a NOT. The PySpark code reads: Filter the dataframe where the POTENTIALSHORTSALE field is NOT like the string 'Not Disclosed'\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Outlier Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "For an initial pass at the model, it might be helpful to remove large outliers. One definition of an outlier for near normally distributed data is something that occurs more than 3 standard deviations from the mean, only 0-point-3% of data should be filtered. Remember outliers occur on both sides, so filter on both sides of the mean!\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Value Filtering Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will filter extreme values from the LISTPRICE column. To start, we will use the aggregate functions standard deviation and mean. Then use collect to force the calculation to run and use the zero, zero index to access the values. Lastly we created a multi-conditional filter, which is just two boolean statements ANDed together. It reads, filter where the LISTPRICE is less than the hi_bound and more than the low_bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Dropping NA's or NULLs\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with missing data is something we will cover later as dropping data is usually a naive approach. Nevertheless, it is important to sometimes take shortcuts to quickly prove out the basis for further work. Dropna does what you'd expect it to do. In its basic form, it will remove a record where there is any null value in any column. You can get more specific as we'll see on the next slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Dropping NA's or NULLs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, we drop any record contains a NULL value. The second example we will look at only two columns and if both are NULL then we will remove the record. Lastly, we can apply a threshold across all the columns and say if more than two columns contain NULL values, remove the entire record.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Dropping Duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicates occur when two or more records contain the exact same information. Often this can happen after you drop columns or join datasets. dropDuplicates will drop the first duplicate it finds. Since Spark is distributed, which one it finds first may or may not be in the order of how your file was loaded. If you want to be more picky about where you are looking for duplicates you can specify a list of column names to look for them there specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Let's practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, we learned why we might have bad data and several ways to remove it so it doesn't adversely impact our analysis. Let's see you take a shot at removing some data in the exercises!\n",

    "## Adjusting Data\n",
    "1. Adjusting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeff Hooper of Bell labs once said, \"data does not give up its secrets easily, it must be tortured to confess.\" This lesson will arm you with the tools to get your data to behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why Transform Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real data is ugly and rarely comes ready to be analyzed. Many algorithms and statistical methods have assumptions that a variable conforms to. If our data doesn't fit these criteria all hope isn't lost yet, we can try mathematical operations to adjust the data to become the beautiful butterflies our methods require.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is MinMax Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "One common transformation is scaling. For many algorithms like KNN or regression, you need to ensure all your variables are on the same scale. One variable can't be from -1000 to 5000 and another between point-01 and point-02, these algorithms will try to reduce the errors in the first variable much more than the second. We can avoid this by scaling each feature between 0 and 1. This is called Minmax scaling and doesn't change the shape of the distribution of only its range. To Minmax scale, take the variable to be scaled, subtract the minimum value and divide by the difference between the max and min.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Minmax Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "To scale our data we need to first find the min and max values of the column we want to scale. Here we are using aggregate functions min and max. We will use collect to force the calculation to run and use the zero, zero index to access the values. To create a new column we will use withColumn that creates a new column based off some sort of transformation to an existing one, in this case, DAYSONMARKET. Lastly, we can see that our values are now all between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is Standardization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common restriction is that the data must closely follow the standard normal distribution. Standardization or z-transforming is the process of shifting and scaling your data to better resemble a standard normal distribution, which has mean of 0 and standard deviation 1. In the image, you can see how the original data in blue, shifts to the green where it has mean 0 and the final step scales it to the standard normal distribution in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "To z transform our data, we calculate the aggregate functions mean and std deviation of the column we are transforming. Since want to use the values in the next step we will use collect to immediately calculate them and use the index values of [0][0] to access the returned values. We can then apply the standardization formula to our column and put the results in a new column ztrans_days by using withColumn. Lastly, we can verify that the transformed data does have approximate mean 0 and std deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is Log Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data for SALESCLOSEPRICE is pushed to the left. This is called positive skew. One potential way to treat skewed data is to apply a log transformation on the data. This has the impact of making our data look more like a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Log Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply a log transformation you will need to import the log function from pyspark sql functions. We can then create a new column log_SalesClosePrice based on the application of the log function on SALESCLOSEPRICE.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Working with Missing Data\n",
    "1. Working with Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data is frustrating, in this lesson we will touch on a few ways to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How does data go missing in the digital age?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does data go missing in the digital age? Sensors can fail, surveys can miss people or new ways to measure things can cause gaps in data sets. Data storage rules can force data that doesn't fit the specified type to be null. For example dates in different formats, abbreviations or a currency with a comma instead of a period. Joining datasets can enrich your model but can induce missing values if they are not at captured at the same granularity. If you combine daily data with monthly data, it will create gaps for all the days where the monthly data was not captured. Lastly, data can be missing intentionally, attributes used in combination might be enough to compromise privacy. This can be seen in government datasets like the census where they will omit data if there is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Types of Missing\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding why your data is missing is important. Missing Completely at Random occurs when the data is missing with no pattern. Your data is likely still representative of the whole population. Missing at Random occurs when the probability of missing data on the Y variable is unrelated to the value of Y. For example, suppose males are less likely to answer a depression survey; this has no relationship with their level of depression, after accounting for maleness. Missing not at random is when the value that is missing is related to the reason why it is missing. Supposing that people with severe health problems do not answer a question asking them to rank their health would indicate missing not at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Assessing Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we showed how to use the function dropna but we didn't talk about when to use it. If your data only has a few missing values and they are missing completely at random it may be fine to remove the rows. But how can we check to see how many missing values we have in our dataset though? We can use the isNull function. It returns true if the condition is true. Here we use it to filter our data to records where they are NULL and then count them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plotting Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use seaborn to help us visualize missing values by leveraging the heatmap function. Using the same steps as before where we sample our data, convert it and then use seaborn to plot the heat map. Note we use pandas DataFrame isnull to convert the dataframe into a T/F for null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Missing Values Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can see the missing values as white spaces in the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Imputation of Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to handle missing values is to replace them. The replacement value might be based on business rules such as missing sales means there were no sales and replace with 0. If the data is missing completely at random, it may make sense to impute them using the mean or the median. Another option could be to use interpolation, creating another model to predict the values. Replacing values shouldn't be done without some serious considerations; make sure you research the appropriateness.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Imputation of Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "To replace missing values we will use pyspark's fillna which takes the value to use for replacement as well as a list of column names. Here we replace values with 0 We can also replace values with the mean by calculating it using an aggregate function and use collect to force the calculation immediately and then access the value by using the zero, zero index. Then col_mean only needs to be placed in the fillna function.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Let's practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, you learned about types of missing data, how to assess missing values and some methods to treat them. Take some time to do the exercises and try out what you learned."

    "1. Getting More Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of Big Data means having access to much more information to include in our analysis. In this video, we will cover how to connect additional data to our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Thoughts on External Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "External data is a wonderful way to boost model performance but there are pros and cons to choosing to include it. Adding external data may add excellent predictors for a model but adding too many features may impact the performance of the model. There is a serious risk of spurious correlations between variables in the world of big data. External data can be a great way to replace missing or aggregated values with a better feature. Adding data comes at the risk of inducing data leakage. If we wish to include local crime information, we will have to ensure that buyers would also have access to that information at the time of purchasing a home. To include data available later is leaking information from the future. Another consideration is how cheap and easy it is to obtain. Today we have many more datasets easily available to us but this may come at the cost of us needing to become the subject matter experts to know the meaning and credibility of our sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. About Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the different kinds of joins we'll need to orient ourselves. We will call the original data set we started with the \"Left\" and the one we wish to incorporate our \"Right\". There are many ways to join data together most commonly the Inner or Left joins depending on your goals. For us, we want to make sure we ALWAYS keep the full LEFT dataset and add data where available from the RIGHT. This means we will be using a LEFT JOIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PySpark DataFrame Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Joins can be done one of two ways in Pyspark. First is the dataframe join method. The dataframe that calls join is the LEFT dataframe. other is the right dataframe, in this case, the new dataset. on is the pairs of column conditions we will match on. how is the type of join to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. PySpark Join Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to see the impact of homes sold on bank holidays. We can join the dataframes together by creating a join condition where df OFFMARKETDATE equals hdf dt We then can put this condition into our join function and use 'left' to make sure we keep all the original records in df. Lastly, count holiday sales by using the tilde to take the NOT of isNull. Not surprising, no houses are sold on a bank holidays, perhaps later we can check if a holiday week impacts sales\n",
    "\n",
    "6. SparkSQL Join\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way we can join dataframes together is to use Spark SQL which allows us to apply SQL statments directly to dataframes. This may be your preferred method if you are familiar with SQL or attempting to do complicated joins or filters. To do this we need to register the dataframe as temp table and give it a name. Once that's done we can then use spark sql to execute a query and return it back in the form of a dataframe. In this one, we are using SELECT star to get all of the columns available, using FROM df to create our starting table, LEFT JOIN hdf as the table we'd like to join with and using ON df OFFMARKETDATE equals hdf dt to create the join condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Let's Join Some Data!\n",
    "\n",
